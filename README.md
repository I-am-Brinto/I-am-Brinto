<b># 🌟 Brinto's Coding Space<b>

👋 Hi there! I'm Brinto, and this is my personal space where I explore programming and try to learn new things step by step.

## 📁 What's in this repo?

This repository is like my digital notebook. It includes:

- 🧠 **DSA Practice** – Stack, Queue, and other data structure problems
- 💻 **Java & C++ Mini Projects** – Basic programs and small apps as I learn
- 🦀 **Rust Experiments** – Just starting to explore this powerful language
- 📚 **Study Notes** – Simple notes on what I’ve learned so far

## 💡 Why this repo?

I wanted a single place to keep all my practice and learning projects.  
It helps me track my progress and maybe help others who are just starting too.
